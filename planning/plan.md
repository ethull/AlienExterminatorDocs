## chat with class supervisor (george)
- features
  - power up feature
    - how to make it difficult
  - simple features from class
    - require alot of innovation
    - new stuff, and they play well
  - features need to hard enougth to get good marks, but not hard enougth that it cant be implemented
  - splitscreen/multiplayer
    - no help from class
    - shows programming impressive skills
    - this feature alone will get us alot of marks
- which game?
  - hard to implement impressive features for infinite runner and fruit ninja
    - as there's not much to the games
  - meteor fruit ninja example
    - he thinks it has no significant features
    - and it doesnt play well
      - poor collision between meteor and player
  - we are marked more on functionality (code) than design
    - does the game play well, is it fun
    - have we thought through the code

## 2nd chat with george
- space shooter idea
  - he's still not happy
  - thinks we should shoot big
    - better to shoot big than get stuck on 2d games
- coming up with a good idea that reflects out ability is part of the assessment
- split screen feature
  - for 2d games its not challenging
  - for 3d games its challenging
    - controllers and inputs
  - he thinks we should do a 3d game
